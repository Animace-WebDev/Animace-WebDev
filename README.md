- Hello World 👋 
- 👀 Hi there! I'm Animesh, somebody who's just trying to get through this crazy world while having some fun and learning a thing or two along the way. I'm a web developer by profession, but interest and goals are much larger than just code. I want to make a positive impact in the world, and code is just one avenue that i use to acieve that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Development 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on bootcamp 
- 📫 Honestly, the best way to reach out ot me is probably via a Direct Message on Linkedin! Feel free to email me as well, if it suits you well. Linkedin is one way to get a immediate hold. 
     
     I'll chat about technology, playing blues on guitar, or really whatever you want! I enjoy sharing experiences, but I enjoy hearing other's personal journeys and opinions more.
